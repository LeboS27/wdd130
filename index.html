            <p>The Matopos, also known as Matobo Hills, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Zimbabwe
                 renowned for its dramatic granite rock formations,
                  ancient San rock art, and rich biodiversity.
                   Located south of Bulawayo, it is home to the Matobo National Park,
                    which hosts a range of wildlife, including rhinos, leopards,
                     and eagles. The area also has historical significance,
                      being the resting place of Cecil Rhodes and a spiritual site for the
                       local Ndebele people. Its stunning landscapes and cultural heritage make it a must-visit destination.</p>
